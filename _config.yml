intro: |
  I am a Computer Science Student at the University ofArkansas at Little Rock. I have primarily worked in C++ throughout my coursework, but have experience in several languages such as: Python, HTML, C#, Assembly, Lisp, SQL. Throughout my studies I also have knowledge in Computer Organization, Data Structure and Algorithms, and Language Structures. I also have a strong background math with courses such as Linear Algebra, Discrete Math, and Number Theory. <br/><br/>
  I have worked on projects with my internships such as an Interactive Floor that uses Computer Vision to allow a projected Unity game to get input from real world movement. To complete the project, I worked on creating a dynamically linked library for Unity to load libraries available in C to C#. Along with that project I have also worked to create a prototype Alexa Skill in python that can help the EAC with public demonstrations and tours.<br/><br/>
  I have internship experience with the Emerging Analytics center with a focus on research and development. I have internship experience with Welspun Tubular LLC in project management. I am currently a Student Ambassador with EIT Student Services and focus on collaboration and tutoring to help underclassmen in subjects related to Computer Science. I am looking for a position in Software Development to continue to grow my coding experience and expertise.
